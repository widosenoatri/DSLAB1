**“Anomaly Detection in Time Series KPIs”**
> This project develops unsupervised anomaly detection techniques for identifying abnormalities in multivariate time series key performance indicators (KPIs) from complex systems. Novel forecasting algorithms leverage sequence-based and dynamical modeling to capture metric contextual interactions over time. Detected KPI anomalies are tracked to related performance metrics across systems to uncover impacted services. The outcomes improve monitoring coverage through interconnected interpretable frameworks.
